**Subject:** Follow-up: Step-by-Step Processes & Prompts for Audit Automation

---

Hi [Strategist Name],

Thank you so much for taking the time to walk me through your audit methodology yesterday. Your insight into how you use ChatGPT to generate strategic insights was incredibly valuable and has completely changed our approach to building the automated audit system.

As we discussed, your method of pulling data and feeding it to ChatGPT with context (industry, benchmarks, date range) is much simpler and more effective than the complex analysis engines we were building. We're now aligning our system to match your workflow.

To ensure we replicate your process accurately, I'd be grateful if you could share:

## 1. Step-by-Step Processes for Each Section

For each report section (KAV Analysis, Flow Performance, Campaign Performance, List Growth, etc.), could you provide:
- The exact steps you follow
- Which metrics/data you pull from Klaviyo
- How you format the data before sending to ChatGPT
- Any specific calculations or transformations you do (if any)

## 2. Prompts You Use for Each Section

This would be incredibly helpful:
- The exact prompt templates you use for each section
- How you structure the prompts (data + context + questions)
- Any variations you use for different industries or client types
- Examples of prompts that work particularly well

## 3. Benchmark Differentiation by Industry

To ensure our insights are industry-appropriate:
- How benchmarks differ by industry (apparel vs. industrial vs. B2B, etc.)
- Which benchmarks you use for each industry
- Where you source your benchmark data
- How you adjust benchmarks for different client sizes or business models

## Why This Information Is Critical

This information will help us:
- **Create accurate prompt templates** that match your methodology
- **Generate industry-specific insights** that are relevant and actionable
- **Ensure consistency** between your manual audits and our automated reports
- **Build a system** that truly replicates your strategic thinking

## What We're Building

Based on our conversation, we're implementing:
- Multi-LLM support (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) so we can match your preferred tool
- Section-by-section prompt templates based on your method
- Industry-specific benchmark integration
- Simple data extraction → LLM → insights workflow (no complex calculations)

Your guidance will ensure we build this correctly from the start, rather than having to iterate later.

## Timeline

We're planning to have the LLM integration complete within the next 2-3 weeks. Having your processes and prompts would significantly accelerate this and ensure we're building exactly what you need.

## Format Preference

You can share this information in whatever format is easiest for you:
- Screenshots of your ChatGPT conversations
- Text documents with the prompts
- A quick screen recording showing your process
- Or even a quick call where you walk me through a few examples

I'm happy to work around whatever format is most convenient for you.

Thank you again for your time and expertise. Your methodology has been a game-changer for how we're approaching this project.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** If it's easier, I'm happy to set up a quick 30-minute call where you can walk me through a couple of sections live. That way I can ask clarifying questions in real-time and ensure I understand your process correctly.
