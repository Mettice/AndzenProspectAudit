Can you give me a insights into Ursaferite's KAV YTD? Structure it similar to this but make it relevant to their performance as attached: 

Owned channels continue to be a critical pillar of Esther & Co.’s revenue strategy, delivering $695K in revenue from January 1 to September 30, 2025,  accounting for 29.5% of total website revenue ($2.36M). This aligns closely with Klaviyo’s 30% KAV benchmark and highlights a strong foundation of lifecycle and retention marketing that is actively contributing to overall performance.
While total website revenue declined -43% YoY, owned revenue saw a comparatively smaller -22.5% YoY decline. This relative outperformance suggests that Esther & Co.’s email and SMS programs are helping to cushion the broader impact of acquisition softness, indicating a more resilient and efficient revenue engine within the owned ecosystem.
can you improve this line here because they have not been sending campaigns this year, only in 2024: Rather than cushioning broader revenue softness, owned performance is currently amplifying it—suggesting opportunities to strengthen flow strategy, increase campaign volume, and improve segmentation to restore owned-channel resilience and move closer to benchmark KAV contribution.
make it more strategic in tone
Can you give me insights on their Campaigns vs Flows. Campaigns are doing 0% which is not ideal since we want to see a balance of share - usually 50/50 or 60/40 where flows drive 60%. Structure it similar to this but make it relevant to their performance as attached: 

Campaigns continue to be the dominant driver of owned revenue for Esther & Co., contributing $510K YTD,  accounting for 73.4% of total KAV. While campaign performance is down -15.2% YoY, this decline is less steep than the -37.3% YoY drop observed in flows, which generated $185K and contributed just 26.6% of total KAV.
This split highlights an imbalance in the revenue mix, with automation underperforming both in scale and growth. In high-performing lifecycle programs, flows often account for at least 40–50% of owned revenue, serving as a consistent, scalable foundation for retention and post-purchase engagement. Esther & Co.’s current flow contribution indicates that automation is an under-leveraged opportunity, especially as flows are often more efficient in driving repeat purchases and mid-to-bottom funnel conversions.
The sharper YoY decline in flow revenue suggests a potential drop in journey effectiveness or gaps in coverage, whether due to missing key lifecycle touchpoints (e.g., replenishment, winback, browse abandonment) or underutilized segmentation and trigger logic. Campaigns, while still pulling weight, are inherently less scalable and more dependent on calendar-based planning.
Can you better explain how flows and campaigns work better together? Campaigns engage the list and  brings them back to the website, those who don't convert from the campaigns may have done actions like adding to cart or browsing products and the flows capture them after campaigns. Explain it better than this, but you get the gist:The lack of campaigns also places disproportionate pressure on flows, limiting reach and reducing KAV potential. While flows deliver efficient automation for mid- and bottom-funnel conversions, they rely on ongoing list activity and fresh traffic - both of which typically come from campaign volume. Without that balance, the lifecycle ecosystem loses momentum.
this is wrong, rephrase it: Campaigns and flows function as a connected ecosystem—not two separate channels.
make this tone more strategic: Campaigns stimulate demand by re-engaging the list, driving fresh traffic, and creating the moments that bring people back to the website. That’s the spark. Once customers are onsite, flows step in to capture intent: browsing, adding to cart, starting checkout, or engaging with specific products. Even if the campaign itself doesn’t convert, it generates the behaviors that trigger high-intent flows.

When campaigns disappear, that upstream traffic dries up. Flows then have fewer opportunities to activate, fewer triggers to fire, and ultimately less revenue to capture—no matter how well-built they are. Campaigns create the volume; flows convert the intent. Together, they form a continuous cycle of engagement and revenue. When one is missing, the entire lifecycle engine loses efficiency and momentum.
Can you give me insights into Ursaferite's email versus SMS KAV? Structure it similar to this but make it relevant to their performance as attached: 

Email remains the cornerstone of Esther & Co.’s owned revenue performance, driving $669K YTD ,  accounting for 96.2% of total KAV. While email revenue declined -22.6% YoY, it continues to underpin the brand’s lifecycle and campaign efforts at scale.
SMS generated $24.9K, representing 3.6% of owned revenue, while Push contributed $1.26K (0.18%). Both SMS and Push saw softer YoY declines (-19% and -0.18%, respectively), but their low share of total KAV signals underutilization. Compared to industry-leading retention brands, where SMS often contributes 10–20%+ of owned revenue, Esther & Co. appears to be early in its omnichannel maturity.
This presents a high-leverage opportunity to diversify channel mix and evolve toward a more customer-led engagement strategy. Klaviyo’s latest features can help unlock this shift:
The Omnichannel Campaign Builder serves as a centralized command center for planning and executing cohesive, multi-touchpoint campaigns across email, SMS, push, and WhatsApp. It enables marketers to architect end-to-end experiences - from seasonal moments to high-intent conversion pushes -  without duplicative setup or fragmented execution.
Channel Affinity AI adds another layer of precision by detecting and responding to how each customer prefers to engage - whether that’s SMS midday, email in the evening, or app push for time-sensitive drops. Embedding this intelligence within flows can optimize performance, reduce fatigue, and tailor channel delivery for maximum impact.


Together, these tools enable Esther & Co. to move from channel-first to customer-first, unlocking a more dynamic lifecycle framework. With email already delivering at scale, the next phase of growth will come from intelligently layering SMS and Push to maximize message resonance, increase downstream revenue, and reduce dependency on a single channel.
Can you revise the below and change it relevant to what Uraferite's needs are? They haven't been sending campaigns so that is the number 1 way that they can grow their KAV. Another is also to expand their automation suite and also make their emails more personalized and dynamic to match the needs and preferences of their customers: 

Esther & Co.’s owned channels contributed $695K YTD, representing 29.5% of total website revenue, right in line with Klaviyo’s 30% benchmark. This confirms a healthy foundation for lifecycle marketing, even as both total site and owned revenue declined YoY. Notably, owned revenue declined at a slower rate (-22.5% vs. -43% YoY), indicating that email and SMS are providing stabilization amid wider acquisition softness.
However, analysis reveals clear optimization opportunities across flows and channel mix:
Flows account for only 26.6% of owned revenue and have declined -37.3% YoY, signaling that automation is under-leveraged both in volume and strategy.


Campaigns, while steadier (-15.2% YoY), still make up 73.4% of total KAV — an over-reliance that limits scalability.


SMS and Push remain nascent contributors (just 3.6% and 0.2% of KAV respectively), but their softer YoY declines suggest stable engagement and untapped potential.
The path forward lies in rebalancing this mix by reinvigorating flows and expanding cross-channel orchestration through Klaviyo’s Omnichannel Campaign Builder and Channel Affinity AI.

Strategic Recommendations
1. Rebuild and Scale the Flow Framework
The goal is to shift the revenue split toward a more balanced 40–50% flow contribution. To drive consistency and scale, flows must transition from passive support to active revenue engines.
Start by expanding and optimizing key automations:
Welcome


Abandoned Cart & Checkout


Browse Abandonment


Post-Purchase


Replenishment & Winback
 
2. Orchestrate Smarter Campaigns with Omnichannel
Use Klaviyo’s Omnichannel Campaign Builder to align lifecycle and promotional efforts across email, SMS, push, and WhatsApp, if applicable. This isn’t about adding noise but building relevance at scale, ensuring campaigns work in tandem with automation, not in isolation, as well as reinforcing your lifecycle strategy during key retail moments.
Coordinate launches across multiple touchpoints without duplicating effort


Vary messaging by lifecycle stage, engagement level, or purchase behavior


Use branching and show/hide logic to tailor the experience within a single send

3. Deploy Channel Affinity AI to Optimize Delivery
With Klaviyo’s Channel Affinity AI, you can now embed send-time and channel preferences into flows and campaigns. This elevates both efficiency and conversion, ensuring messages reach customers when and where they’re most likely to act,  not just when they’re scheduled.
Use it to:
Prioritize the right touchpoint for each customer (e.g., email vs. SMS vs. push)


Adjust cadence and timing based on real-time engagement patterns


Dynamically re-segment users as behaviors shift over time


4. Expand Use Cases to Maximize Lifecycle Depth
Flows shouldn’t stop at the basics. Leverage Esther & Co.’s tech stack to build deeper, higher-intent journeys through custom events and integrations. 
For example:
Wishlist Flows
Review Request Flow
Review Reward Flow: Offer coupons in exchange for verified reviews
Loyalty Milestone Flow (Esther Rewards)
5. Improve Top-of-Funnel Capture & Lifecycle Readiness
Growing KAV isn’t just about sending more emails or SMS, it’s also about capturing smarter. Strengthen top-of-funnel acquisition with optimized on-site forms and incentives, and introduce audience qualification logic that filters high-intent leads. This ensures that as the list grows, it remains healthy, engaged, and primed for lifecycle monetization.
 Focus on refreshing the database with high-intent, opt-in-ready profiles via:
Tiered or seasonal incentives on pop-ups


Checkout opt-ins where purchase intent is highest


Contextual sign-up forms aligned with product category or collection


can you summarize the strategic recommendations and make it just one paragraph
can you make the tone more strategic
Can you rephrase this: This creates a clear and high-impact opportunity. Ursaferite can meaningfully grow KAV by reintroducing campaigns as the primary engine of engagement and pairing them with a more robust, personalized automation suite. Flows excel at capturing intent, but only after campaigns bring customers back to the website. Without campaigns, the lifecycle system loses momentum—and that is exactly what the data shows.
In parallel, the brand can strengthen performance by evolving email content beyond static sends. Introducing dynamic blocks, personalized logic, and segmentation by behavior, purchase history, and preferences will increase relevance and lift downstream conversions.

is this sentence correct:  Integrating conditional blocks that dynamically reflect each customer’s preferences, purchase history, and profile data will increase message relevance and drive stronger downstream conversions.
Can you give me insights into the email list growth and attrition for Usaferite? Structure it similar to this but make it relevant to their performance as attached: 

Esther & Co.’s email list closed September 2025 with 239,470 active subscribers, marking a -4.45% decrease vs. the previous period. This contraction reflects a significant imbalance between acquisition and attrition, with 11,642 new subscribers added year-to-date, but 22,795 exclusions — nearly double the gains — leading to a net list decline across the year.
List decline has been steady and sustained month-over-month, with subscriber losses outpacing growth in every month from January to September. This trend suggests a structural issue in list health and retention, rather than a seasonal or campaign-driven fluctuation. Without intervention, the list is on track to continue shrinking, limiting campaign reach and owned revenue scale over time.

Opt-In Sources: Shrinking Acquisition Funnel
Subscriber acquisition is slowing. The top opt-in sources show declining contribution across the board:
Shopify integration delivered 7,091 subscribers, but this is down -56.02% vs. the prior period — possibly due to reduced on-site form engagement or lower overall traffic.


The Welcome 2023 form brought in 4,058 subscribers, down -13.07%, signaling that the incentive or form placement may be losing relevance or visibility.


Minimal acquisition from API subscribe (2) and manual upload (1) reflects a lack of diversification or new lead capture tactics.
While there was a spike in suppression reactivations (+999% YoY), these are reclaimed rather than new net-new profiles, and may not represent highly engaged users.

High Churn Is Driving Contraction
Total exclusions YTD reached 22,795, down -10.5% YoY, but still materially outpacing acquisition. Key drivers of churn include:
Email link unsubscribe (11,031) – the most common source of attrition, though down -44.2% YoY.


One-click unsubscribe (9,758) – up +229.1%, indicating growing friction with campaign frequency or content relevance.


Spam complaints (690, -44.3%) and hard bounces (1,457, -18.1%) were relatively stable, but still signal areas for improved deliverability and segmentation.


This means that nearly 66% of all churn came from user-initiated unsubscribes, not system-driven factors, highlighting the need to refine messaging cadence, targeting, and value exchange across lifecycle and promotional sends.

Key Opportunities
Rebuild and Optimize Signup Ecosystem
Rethink existing pop-ups and forms to test new incentives, formats, and placements. Seasonal lead capture (e.g., Black Friday giveaways, birthday club, mystery discount) and behavior-triggered forms can bring more engaged profiles.


Re-engage Before They Leave

Implement preference centers, opt-down options, or mid-funnel surveys to intercept users before they fully unsubscribe. Add friction to one-click unsubscribe journeys to encourage a second chance.


Reinforce Lifecycle Onboarding
Strengthen Welcome flows and post-signup journeys with clearer product education, value reminders, and low-barrier CTAs to convert early and boost engagement before disengagement sets in.


Monitor and Personalize Sends
Consider engagement-based sending rules and Klaviyo’s Channel Affinity AI to route disengaged users to alternative channels like SMS or Push instead of overloading email.


Segment for List Hygiene
Create a sunset flow for disengaged users and implement real-time segmentation to avoid repeated sends to contacts who are close to churn. Use clickers vs openers to refine deliverability risk groups.
Can you give me insights on Ursaferite's SMS list growth and attrition? Structure it similar to this but make it relevant to their performance (attached): 

Esther & Co.’s SMS list saw modest growth YTD, reaching 149,445 active subscribers — a +2.28% lift vs. the previous period. This growth was largely driven by low attrition rather than strong acquisition. With only 3,888 new subscribers and 556 exclusions, net growth remains positive but minimal, suggesting SMS is currently operating as a stable but underutilized channel in the owned mix.
Growth has been steadily tapering off since April. Monthly acquisition volume has dropped consistently from a peak of ~750 new SMS subscribers in April to under 200 by August–September. This downward trend raises a flag around lead generation stagnation.

Opt-In Sources: Limited Volume, Heavy Reliance
SMS acquisition is overwhelmingly reliant on a single source:
Welcome 2023 accounted for 3,594 subscribers, down -18.6%, yet still far outpacing any other source.


Other opt-in methods are contributing negligible volume:


SMS List Upload: 236 (↓ -24.4%)


Shopify Integration: 87 (↓ -69.1%)


Bali Pop-Up: 33 (↓ -34%)


15% Welcome | ZP: 29 (↓ -32.6%)


The sharp YoY declines across all top sources indicate that the SMS opt-in ecosystem is not actively growing, and lacks diversity in entry points. With the Welcome form carrying almost the entire SMS acquisition effort, any underperformance here materially impacts growth.

Exclusions: Low Volume, But Preference-Driven
YTD exclusions were just 556, down -33.1% YoY, indicating healthy SMS list retention. However, the most common churn source — Preference Page (493 unsubscribes) — reveals that users are still proactively opting out rather than dropping passively.
This suggests that while SMS messages may not be driving high complaint rates or deliverability issues, there’s still a relevance or frequency mismatch prompting opt-outs through intentional disengagement.

Strategic Implications
SMS remains a high-potential but low-utilization channel for Esther & Co. With 96% of owned revenue still coming from email, expanding SMS’s role, especially in flows and time-sensitive campaigns, is a clear next step.


The growth in subscribers is almost entirely from retention, not acquisition. That’s not sustainable,  and without a stronger pipeline of SMS opt-ins, future omnichannel orchestration will be constrained.


Esther & Co.’s reliance on a single Welcome form (and no high-performing mobile-specific incentive) makes the channel highly vulnerable to stall.
This section doesn't sound too right, it simply means SMS subscribers are opting out: 

Churn Drivers: Low Volume, But User-Initiated

Total SMS exclusions are low (65 YTD), but the most common churn drivers reveal areas for optimization:

Preference Page: 114 unsubscribes (↓ -27.85%)

Other: 110 unsubscribes (↑ +134.04%)

That over 90% of churn is user-initiated (via the preference center or “Other”) suggests that opt-outs are not being driven by carrier issues or system suppressions, but rather by content relevance or send frequency.

This is a key signal to fine-tune cadence, timing, and segmentation—particularly as the brand expands SMS across more lifecycle flows and promotional campaigns.
Can you give me insights on Ursaferite's list engagement breakdown? Structure it similar to this but make it relevant to their performance (attached): 

Esther & Co. currently has 207,549 active profiles, yet only 27.82% are classified as Very Engaged, with another 3.33% Somewhat Engaged - totaling 31.15% of the list actively engaging. This falls well below the industry benchmark of 50% engagement, suggesting a large share of profiles are either not engaging with current content or are under-activated in the lifecycle.
An additional 3.10% are Barely Engaged, and 3.63% are classified as Not Engaged, indicating a modest pool of contacts teetering on disengagement - a prime audience for winback efforts or suppression evaluation.
A Major Concern: 90.90% Received No Emails
The most critical insight is that nearly two-thirds (62.13%) of all active profiles have not received a single email in the past 30 days. That equates to over 129,000 marketable contacts - profiles that are technically eligible for campaigns or flows, yet have been entirely excluded from email touchpoints in the past month.
This is not just an engagement problem. It’s a visibility, revenue, and cost-efficiency issue.
Billing Impact of “Received No Emails” Profiles in Klaviyo
Klaviyo charges based on the total number of active profiles, regardless of whether they’ve received email sends. This includes anyone who is:
Not suppressed


Recently active on-site or via flows


Technically marketable (opted-in)


For Esther & Co., this means approximately 129k contacts are incurring cost without contributing to engagement or revenue. These profiles make up the largest portion of the list, and are currently an unmonetized asset

Strategic Implications
Wasted Spend
Esther & Co. may be significantly overpaying for unutilized contacts. This inflates cost per engaged subscriber and weakens ROI from owned channels. Without reactivation or suppression logic, this portion of the list becomes a silent tax on your Klaviyo contract.
Lost Revenue Opportunity
These profiles are not suppressed, which means they’re still fair game for reactivation - they’re just not being targeted. Whether this is due to segmentation, list hygiene concerns, or flow misconfigurations, the result is the same: hundreds of thousands of dollars in missed monetization potential.
Deliverability Risk
Reintroducing 129K+ cold profiles to campaigns without proper warming or segmentation poses risks:
Open rates may drop below inbox thresholds
Unsubscribe and spam rates may spike
Overall sender reputation may suffer, impacting inbox placement for your most engaged customers
To clarify, a healthy email list typically has over 50% of subscribers in the “Very Engaged” or “Somewhat Engaged” categories and no more than 25% classified as “Not Engaged.”  Can you revise your insights based on this additional info. 
Can you make the tone more strategic and less criticizing: The most concerning metric is that 90.90% of all active profiles (16,640 contacts) have received zero emails in the past 30 days. These profiles are technically marketable—not suppressed, bounced, or unsubscribed—yet have been entirely excluded from flows and campaigns.

This is not an engagement problem—it’s an execution gap.
This is wrong because the issue is they haven't been sending campaigns this year, just flows: Rather than an issue of disengagement, the data points to a targeting and execution opportunity—one that, if addressed strategically, could significantly improve list performance and cost efficiency.
Improve this to say that many of them will likely respond to campaigns or something like that: Missed Revenue 
These profiles are still marketable - many of them are likely eligible for campaigns, winback flows, or reactivation. They’re just not being touched.
change the term 'and many'
Rephrase it because it sounds like we're assuming that many will respond
Can you give me insights on Ursaferite's popup form performance? Structure the insights similar to this but make it relevant to their performance (attached): 

SafeStyle’s current popup offering "$10 off for new subscribers" is driving the majority of list growth, performing strongly with a 3.46% submission rate. This rate stems from 591k impressions and approx. 20k submissions, falling comfortably within the 3–6% benchmark. This indicates a strong performance, resonating with users and efficiently capturing profiles. 
Can you make this relevant to Ursaferite: 

While discounts are common and effective at capturing emails, layering in a GWP can elevate perceived value, especially for a brand like SafeStyle where accessories (e.g., lens wipes, protective cases, anti-fog sprays) are practical and cost-effective to offer.
Skin care? I don't think they sell that
Ursaferite is an industrial safety equipment store. Your examples are wrong
Can you put this in the table and revise the example copy here to match Ursaferite:

Here are additional data capture methods we can implement to accelerate list growth:
Returning Customer Form
This form is built to target past customers who haven’t opted into marketing emails, ensuring that Ursaferite doesn’t miss the opportunity to re-engage loyal shoppers. Using a segment in Klaviyo (customers with order history but without email consent), the form is triggered on-site when these known customers return, giving them a second chance to subscribe.
Rather than displaying a generic sitewide popup, this version delivers a more personalized, context-aware invitation, such as: “Hey again! Since you’ve shopped with us before, we’d love to keep you in the loop. Sign up to get first dibs on new drops and exclusive offers.”
Because this audience has already completed a purchase, the message feels like a natural extension of their relationship with the brand, not a cold opt-in request. It's an easy, low-friction way to turn one-time buyers into repeat, engaged subscribers.
Exit Intent Form
An exit intent form detects when a visitor is about to leave the site , often by tracking cursor movement toward the browser’s close button, and then displays a targeted pop-up. This last-chance offer or message can capture otherwise lost leads by showcasing an incentive, highlighting a key value proposition, or inviting them to subscribe before they go.
Post-Checkout Popup
For customers who complete a purchase but haven’t subscribed to marketing emails, a post-checkout popup provides a high-intent opt-in opportunity. This is a moment of elevated engagement - they just purchased - and the ask feels natural, not intrusive.
This can be triggered on the order confirmation page with a message like:
“Thanks for your order! Want to be the first to hear about new drops and exclusive offers? Join our mailing list.”
Since these customers have already demonstrated purchase intent, they’re prime candidates for the Welcome flow and long-term retention.
Improve this to add that we are targeting visitors who have dismissed the main form: Captures visitors who are about to leave the site without subscribing by triggering a last-chance offer.
Can you give me insights on Ursaferite's welcome series relative to industry benchmarks? Structure it similar to this but make it relevant to their performance (attached): 

Open rate is on par with the industry average (51.52%), indicating solid inbox placement and subject lines that resonate with subscribers at the top of the funnel.
Opportunity: With top-performing brands reaching up to 74.64%, testing curiosity-based subject lines or emphasizing exclusivity (e.g., “You’re in - Here’s what’s next”) could help lift performance into the top decile.
The click rate is slightly below the industry average of 4.55%, and well behind the top 10% benchmark of 14.81%, the click rate suggests that while users are opening emails, the in-email content may not be driving interaction.
Placed order rate is a strong result, 2x higher than the industry average (2.00%), and points to a well-performing bridge between email and the website experience. Customers who do click are clearly converting, suggesting high purchase readiness and likely alignment between messaging and merchandising.
The Welcome Series is the second highest revenue-generating flow, contributing 19.54% of Esther & Co.’s total YTD flows revenue (A$185,091.46). This strong performance highlights the flow’s importance in driving first-time purchase conversion. As one of the earliest lifecycle touchpoints, it not only delivers immediate value but also sets the tone for brand experience and long-term retention.
I need it to be just one paragraph 
Your insights are wrong. It looks like the open rates are low because the last few emails have low open rates. Their welcome flow spans 40 days and only the first few emails sent day 0-4 are performing well in terms of opens and clicks. By day 8 to 40, engagement metrics are slipping which makes sense because the first 7 days are more crucial for new subscribers. The longer a new subscriber stays in the welcome series in the purchase, the more disengaged they get. 
For Areas of Opportunity, can you suggest putting more emphasis on the first 7 days? Right now there are only 3 emails from Day 0 - Day 8 and another 3 emails from Day 8 onwards (until Day 40). We can compress this to the first 7-10 days because this is the most crucial time for conversion among new subscribers. Give me a title for this too. 
Can you rephrase this because it's not their data that shows this: However, performance data clearly shows that most engagement and conversions occur within the first 7 days—the window when new subscribers are most attentive and likely to act. 
Another area of opportunity is creating conditional hero based on the shopping preference. This means surfacing women's imagery to female shoppers and men's imagery to male shoppers. If the profile property is empty, it will show a more universal hero. Can you revise the below based on this suggestion: 

Klaviyo’s latest aggregated report shows that personalisation is the key to reaching top-tier performance in welcome series metrics. A great first step would be to segment new subscribers by shopping preference (Mens, Womens, Both/Default), allowing us to deliver content that feels more tailored and relevant to each audience. 
also suggest adding dynamic product feeds based on shopping preference
Make the product feed a separate suggestion
Can you give me insights on Ursaferite's Abandoned Cart performance relative to industry benchmarks? Structure it similar to below but make it relevant to their performance (attached): 

The Normal Brand’s combined Abandoned Checkout flows contributed $240K+ in revenue, affirming their critical role in recapturing intent-rich shoppers. Open rates across all three flows are consistent with the industry average (51.43%), with the Black Crow version leading at 52.7%, indicating healthy subject line performance but still trailing the top 10% benchmark of 66.67%. 
Click rates, however, fall short of the 6.25% average, especially in the 2025 flow (3.44%) - highlighting the need to boost in-email conversion cues, such as clearer CTAs, personalized content, and cart urgency messaging. 
While the 2024 flow outperforms on Placed Order Rate (4.12% vs. 3.42% avg), the 2025 (2.96%) and Black Crow (1.89%) versions suggest conversion drop-off post-click, potentially due to checkout friction or less persuasive final messaging. Collectively, these flows are strong mid-funnel revenue drivers, but could benefit from testing CTA enhancements, stronger personalization, and dynamic elements to lift performance closer to top-tier benchmarks.
Don't start with this one because it is not a strong revenue: Ursaferite’s combined Abandoned Cart Reminder (Added to Cart trigger) and Abandoned Checkout Reminder flows contributed a total of A$20,059.62 in revenue, highlighting their importance in recapturing high-intent shoppers. 
Can you improve this and make it relevant to Ursaferite's performance. Basically, both flows are using a 2-hour trigger but we could test the Abandoned Checkout flow to fire earlier like 20 minutes or an hour because the intent is higher. Both flows are also showing underperformance in open rates so A/B testing the timing can help us understand when cart abandoners are more receptive to abandoned cart emails: 

A/B Test Send Time for Abandoned Cart Emails
Both the Add to Cart and Started Checkout flows are currently underperforming on open rates compared to industry benchmarks, a signal that timing may be impacting visibility and engagement. This presents an opportunity to A/B test different send delays to better match when Esther & Co.’s audience is most receptive to recovery emails.
Since shoppers who reach checkout are higher-intent, the timing of follow-up is critical. Sending too soon may feel abrupt, while waiting too long can allow purchase intent to fade. For example, a Started Checkout email might benefit from being triggered earlier, such as within 30–60 minutes, to recapture attention while decision-making is still active. In contrast, Add to Cart flows may perform better with a slightly longer delay, allowing time for continued browsing or comparison.
Testing a range of delay windows (e.g., 30 minutes, 2 hours, or 4 hours) helps tailor the recovery strategy to real customer behavior, which can lead to improved open rates and better conversion outcomes.
Another area of opportunity is restructuring the flow to make better use of segmentation. Right now, both the Added to Cart and Started Checkout flows are segmented by whether the customer has a sale item in their cart. If no, the flow further splits whether or not the customer can SMS or not. Those opted in to SMS receives an SMS reminder. Their current structure is not wrong but we see better results with New vs. Returning customer split. 

Can you suggest that we can segment the flow between New and Returning instead. This would allow messaging to align more closely with each group’s stage in the customer journey, building confidence and trust for first-time buyers while reinforcing value and loyalty for returning customers, ultimately leading to more relevant communication and higher conversion rates. 
New customers can receive a version of the email that highlights first-time perks, like reminding them of their unused welcome code displayed dynamically within the email to gently reinforce the offer and encourage completion of their first order.
Returning customers could benefit from seeing their loyalty points balance, along with personalised messages that acknowledge their continued support and suggest designs tailored to their purchase history. Incorporating elements of urgency and scarcity, such as "Hurry, your favorite design is almost out of stock," can heighten the sense of immediacy and motivate quicker decision-making, driving faster conversions.

Then, give me a table on how we can differentiate the content between Added to Cart and Started Checkout flows.  
replace the word elevate here: Ursaferite’s current Abandoned Cart and Abandoned Checkout flows are segmented based on whether the customer has a sale item in their cart, followed by a split for SMS eligibility. While this structure is functional, there’s an opportunity to elevate performance by restructuring the segmentation around customer type—New vs. Returning.
Can you give me insights on Ursaferite's Browse Abandonment flow relative to industry benchmarks. Structure it similar to this but make it relevant to their performance (attached): 

Esther & Co.’s Browse Abandonment – Standard flow saw 4,101 entries YTD, with an open rate of 58.53% that exceeds the industry benchmark of 54.10%, signaling strong initial engagement. 
The click rate of 4.74% meets the industry average, confirming that the content sparks interest and drives site visits. However, the placed order rate of 0.44% falls short of the 0.82% benchmark, suggesting a breakdown between click and conversion. 
This drop-off highlights opportunities to optimize the landing experience, build urgency, and test more personalized product blocks to better convert engaged browsers into buyers.


can you improve this and make it a suggestion to add more touchpoints: Limited Touchpoints Leave Revenue on the Table
Can you change this example and make it relevant to Ursaferite: 

For example, follow-up emails could showcase coordinated styles based on what the shopper viewed (e.g. matching accessories or similar silhouettes), or highlight other pieces from the same collection. This not only reinforces the shopper’s interest but also helps reduce decision fatigue by positioning Esther & Co. as the most curated, stylish option.

Use this opportunity to highlight best-selling collections like Dresses or Occasionwear, reinforce values such as feminine elegance, flattering fits, and customer-loved styles, and introduce popular features like Afterpay or styling guides. The aim is to create confidence in the brand and inspire that first purchase with a clear sense of Esther & Co.’s signature aesthetic.
Returning customers: These customers are already familiar with the brand, so personalization becomes key. Reference their past browsing or purchase behavior to spotlight similar styles or new arrivals in their preferred category (e.g., if they viewed loungewear, show coordinating sets or trending seasonal edits). 
can you improve this: Another way to segment the Browse Abandonment flow is segmenting based on frequency of browsing bvehaviour. 
Can you make these relevant to Urasefite: 

Collection Browse Abandonment
Visitor views a collection page but doesn’t click into a specific product
When a shopper lands on a collection page, like Dresses, New Arrivals, or Bridal, but exits without clicking into a specific product, it signals passive interest. They’re browsing at the category level but may need more inspiration or guidance to dive deeper.
This is a great opportunity to spotlight the style story behind the collection. Feature curated edits like “Most-Loved Dresses This Season” or “Stylist Picks for Spring Events,” or highlight bestsellers that have a strong track record of converting. 
Including quotes or reviews from real customers adds social proof, while editorial-style layouts or lookbook imagery can help the shopper imagine how to wear the collection in real life.


Site-Abandonment 
Active on Site: Visitors who leave without viewing a collection
If someone visits Esther & Co.’s site and exits after only browsing the homepage, About Us, or Giving Back pages, without clicking into a specific collection, it’s likely they’re in the early stages of discovery. They’re curious about the brand but haven’t yet taken the next step toward shopping.
This is an ideal moment to follow up with a broad, trust-building email that introduces what makes Esther & Co. unique. Highlight signature collections like Dresses, Occasionwear, or Best Sellers, and pair them with quick, compelling benefits such as flattering fits, feminine design, and customer-loved silhouettes. 


Browse Search
Visitor uses the search bar (e.g., “maxi dresses,” “jeans”) but doesn’t take action
Dynamically feature products matching their exact search terms. Layer in complementary styling recommendations and editorial imagery to show how the pieces fit into their wardrobe. This makes it easier and more compelling to return and purchase.

For example, open with a headline like: “Looking for a maxi dress?” Then dynamically feature best-selling maxi dresses, paired with styling suggestions like accessories.





Can you give me insights on Ursaferite's Post Purchase performance relative to industry benchmarks? Structure it similar to the one below but make it relevant to their performance (attached):

The Post Purchase performance for SafeStyle shows a mixed picture relative to apparel industry benchmarks (60.09% open rate, 3.33% click rate, and 0.52% placed order rate). While SafeStyle’s average click rate sits well above benchmark at approx. 10.5%, indicating strong content and engagement, open rates are notably lower at an average of 38.8%, suggesting room to optimise subject lines, send times, or deliverability. 
The placed order rates across the post purchase journey average around 0.13%, below the industry average and far from the top-performer benchmark of 1.99%, pointing to a clear opportunity to improve conversion through more compelling value propositions, dynamic product recommendations, or offer testing. 
Revenue is heavily weighted toward transactional touchpoints like Order Confirmation, Shipment, and Delivered emails, while retention-oriented flows such as Product Review, Customer Thank You, and Replenishment generate significantly less, indicating a gap in post-purchase nurturing. This pattern suggests that while engagement is strong once emails are opened, there’s a need to lift visibility and better convert interest into action, especially in flows aimed at driving repeat purchases.
This is wrong because we don't expect Customer Winback to have high engagement since we're funneling lapsed customers who are no longer engaged but say that we can still improve it: Meanwhile, the Customer Winback Flow (Email & SMS) appears to be underperforming, with the lowest placed order rate at 0.11% and an open rate of just 33.75%. This suggests re-engagement efforts may need rethinking - such as revamping the offer, segmenting based on last product purchased or average order value, and timing the messages more strategically (e.g., earlier in the lapse window or staggered by purchase history). 
Change this to using Klaviyo's predictive analytics as trigger. So if they don't purchase by the time Klaviyo predictes them to, we can send them the winback emails:  for example, experimenting with earlier triggers in the lapse window or adding additional touchpoints before final suppression.
Rephrase it. Make the tone strategic
For areas of opportunity, we can suggest a cross-sell flow triggered by PDNO. Currently, their Post Purchase flow spans the first 20 days from placed order but only for first time customers. Repeat customers only get 1 email which is a thank you email. 

Revise this and make it relevant to Ursaferite:

Introduce a Cross-Sell Flow (Triggered by Predicted Date of Next Order)
Instead of sending these emails at a fixed time (40 days after someone places an order), Klaviyo uses AI to predict when each customer is statistically most likely to place their next order. The flow activates right before that moment.
Using PDNO as the trigger ensures reminders land when each customer is statistically most likely to buy, rather than blasting the entire list at an arbitrary timeframe. Customers get reminded when their buying intent is strongest, not on an arbitrary schedule.

First-time customers
Customers in this segment are most likely to repurchase within the same product category they first explored. For example, someone who buys a dress is often inclined to purchase another dress on their next order.
To cater to this behaviour, it’s effective to configure a personalized product feed that highlights similar items - for instance, if they bought a maxi dress, the follow-up could feature maxi dresses in different hues or styles). This reinforces their preference while making the next purchase decision seamless and familiar. 
To validate this, we can A/B test two approaches:
Product Type Consistency: Show the same style they purchased (e.g., maxi dresses) but in new prints or colours.


Palette Consistency: Surface different product types (e.g., short dresses, midi dresses, skirts) within the same color family or print.
This test would help determine whether customers respond more to style repetition or color/print affinity, giving clearer direction for future personalization.

2x Purchasers
Second-time purchasers are often more open to broadening their wardrobe with complementary pieces. For example, if they’ve bought a dress, a tailored jacket or statement jewelry styled around that look can inspire them to “complete the look.” 
At this stage, we already know these customers see value not only in The Normal Brand’s designs but also in their shopping experience. The next step is to deepen that connection, positioning the brand as a go-to destination for building a full wardrobe. 
Cross-Category recommendations: When a customer shops again, it’s the perfect time to reintroduce them to Esther & Co.’s broader collection, pairing their recent purchase with complementary pieces like matching tops and bottoms, or accessories that complete the look. 
Curate recommendations in similar colors, prints, or fabrics they already love, positioning them as effortless add-ons to their existing wardrobe.
Incorporating cross-category styling not only inspires outfit building but also deepens brand connection, encouraging customers to see Esther & Co. as their go-to destination for versatile, styled-from-head-to-toe looks

Repeat Customers (3+ orders)
Repeat customers are not just buying your products; they are embracing the lifestyle and values embodied by your brand. They align with your brand's unique identity, making purchasing decisions that resonate with how your brand makes them feel. These customers are likely to purchase across all categories because they connect deeply with your brand's ethos.
Additionally, for customers who have made multiple purchases, convenience often drives their buying decisions. A tailored product feed that showcases items matching their style, size, and tastes based on their purchase history, can be highly effective. 
This strategy  focuses on their preference for variety while ensuring consistency with their established tastes and preferences. This email may include: 
Exclusive previews of new collections.
Showcase curated edits that reflect their past purchase history (e.g., color palettes, fabrics, or silhouettes they favor).
Emphasize ‘surprise & delight’ loyalty perks, early access, or “first to know” benefits.
Editorial styling cues: Show how collections can be styled together, making it effortless for customers to see value in expanding across categories. 
The examples here are wrong. They don't sell linen dresses at Ursaferite: For example, a buyer of a linen dress may be shown coordinating footwear, a cropped blazer, or signature belts that complete the look.


Curate edits that echo their past preferences—such as color families or fabric textures—to make outfit building seamless and inspiring.
This one also doesn't sound relevant to Ursaferite. Can you revise it: 

Repeat Customers (3+ Orders)

At this stage, shoppers aren’t just buying individual items—they’re buying into the Ursaferite lifestyle. These customers resonate with the brand’s aesthetic and values and are often multi-category buyers.

Strategy:

Use purchase history to tailor feeds by size, preferred colors, and product categories.

Include editorial-style inspiration that positions Ursaferite as a full-wardrobe solution.

Email Modules Might Include:

Early access to limited releases or exclusive styles.

Curated “Your Wardrobe Picks” based on past purchases.

“Wear It Your Way” styling features to help them get more out of their Ursaferite favorites.

Loyalty callouts or soft-tier perks (e.g., surprise gifts, VIP preview invites).
Can you revise this as well and make it relevant to Ursaferite: 

Advanced Cross-Sell Segmentation
Another effective cross-sell strategy looks beyond purchase count and instead considers a customer’s lifetime value (CLTV) and lifecycle stage to shape more meaningful recommendations. 
Customers who enter through introductory items (such as accessories or sale items) can be nurtured toward higher-value hero products. 
Examples: 
Entry-price shoppers (accessories, basics, or sale finds) → Introduce elevated, full-priced styles like statement dresses, blouses, or coordinated sets to inspire a wardrobe upgrade.


Category loyalists (e.g., frequent dress or top buyers) → Recommend complementary categories such as outerwear,bottoms, or accessories to complete their look and drive multi-category engagement.


Sale-driven shoppers → Keep them active with “New to Sale” or “Seasonal Steals” edits, while weaving in select full-priced pieces to gradually shift perception toward investment items.


High-value, full-price buyers → Surface new arrivals, limited-run collections, or best-selling premium styles to maintain excitement and reinforce their status as loyal brand advocates.
I need to audit Ursaferite's campaigns performance but they did not send out any campaigns in 2025 so I'm going to analyze their 2024 performance instead. In the brief, it was mentioned that they haven't sent campaigns for a while as the last agency they engaged to do this wasn't able to generate ROI. He suspects this is due to a lack of segmentation but he's interested in our thoughts of his database and if we see a way to build sustainable revenue from campaigns.

Looking at the 2024 campaigns, it looks like the list was too small. The segment size were below 5k but metrics were actually good. Can you give me insights based on this, as well as what their 2024 performance was like (attached).  Basically, we want to suggest regular campaign sends. They have 18k in the database now and 91% haven't received emails in the last 30 days. We can start with 2-3x a week. 
Can you give me an introduction for this section
I need you to mention that they have not sent any campaigns in 2025 so for the purpose of this audit, we will look at 2024 
Rephrase it
Can you change this insight because it does look like they were sending inconsistently  in 2024, for example, just 1 email in February, 3 in April, 2 in May and 1 in June. Explain how this can impact spam complaints and unsubscribe. Other than that, they were batching and blasting to all the list: 2. Attrition Rates Suggest List Hygiene Needs Attention

Spam complaint (0.078%) and unsubscribe (1.4%) rates were flagged as poor. This may be the result of inconsistent sending, limited segmentation, or poor expectation setting with subscribers. Without a consistent send rhythm, people forget why they signed up—which often leads to complaints or opt-outs.
Can you revise this based on that insight: 

Strategic Recommendations for 2025
✅ Start Sending Regular Campaigns (2–3x per Week)

Ursaferite’s database has grown to 18,000 profiles, yet 91% have not received a single email in the past 30 days. That’s a huge untapped revenue opportunity.

Start with:

2–3 campaigns per week (e.g., product spotlights, industry-specific gear guides, seasonal edits)

Smart send segmentation based on engagement (e.g., 90-day openers) to maintain deliverability as we rewarm the list

Gradual re-engagement of dormant profiles via winback campaigns and targeted automations

🎯 Layer in Segmentation Early

To avoid repeating the last agency’s mistakes, segment sends by:

Customer type (New vs Returning)

Industry or job role (e.g., Construction, Mining, Warehousing – if known or inferred)

Product interest or past category browsed

Engagement level (Highly Engaged, Somewhat Engaged, Dormant)

Segmentation will improve engagement rates, personalize the journey, and help spread out the risk of unsubscribes by targeting the right audiences with the right message.

📊 Monitor Unsubscribes + Complaints Closely

Given the historical issue with attrition, be mindful when reintroducing sends:

Use soft re-engagement CTAs and low-frequency for dormant profiles

A/B test subject line tone and send timing

Consider adding a “receive less emails” option in footers for list control
Can you put it in a table
For the post purchase section, can you also recommend a Reviews Generation and Review Coupon flow? This is a gap in their customer journey
Can you rephrase this and don't use the word 'lack': Ursaferite currently lacks a Reviews Flow. Collecting UGC and testimonials builds social proof, improves conversion rates, and fuels future marketing assets.
